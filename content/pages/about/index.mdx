## background

started coding to automate boring stuff. got hooked on the problem-solving aspect. now i build full-stack applications that people actually use.

recent internships taught me how software works at scale:

- **worthington enterprises**: built competitor monitoring agents with gpt-4 that protected 20m+ revenue
- **cialfo**: optimized database queries serving 100k+ students globally  
- **ohio wesleyan**: automated alumni data migration, unlocked 500k+ in new fundraising leads

## technical stuff

primarily work with typescript, python, and modern web frameworks. comfortable with cloud infrastructure, databases, and ai integration. enjoy the entire stack from database design to user interfaces.

recent projects:

- **event organizer ai**: autonomous platform that negotiates with vendors via phone calls
- **thread library**: kernel-level c++ threading implementation
- **loan bidding marketplace**: real-time websocket-based bidding system

## when not coding

swimming, soccer, weightlifting. photography when traveling. always looking for the next interesting problem to solve.

currently based in delaware, ohio. open to opportunities that involve building something meaningful.
